## About Me  
After nearly a decade as a lawyer leading the regulatory area of the oil & gas sector, I made a career transition into IT. My background in exact sciences — developed through service in the Brazilian Navy, Mechanical Engineering studies, and years teaching physics and calculus — gives me a strong foundation in problem-solving and structured thinking.

I deepened my technical expertise through specialized training at the University Institute of Lisbon – ISCTE, obtaining a Java programming certification. During that period I designed a Personal Finance Management System using IntelliJ (Java / OOP) and developed a robust information system powered by MySQL. I also authored a technical report and built a Spring Boot application, managed via Jira and designed in Figma.

My most recent experience includes supporting data-migration projects via the Anypoint Platform (MuleSoft) and working in Agile teams using Azure DevOps. I hold certifications from Microsoft (Azure Fundamentals) and Google (Cloud Digital Leader) — reinforcing my commitment to staying at the forefront of cloud technologies.

Feel free to connect — I’m always open to interesting opportunities and collaborations.
